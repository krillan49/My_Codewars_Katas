The fight of Khabib Nurmagomedov and Tony Ferguson, the 2 best lightweights of the 2nd half of 2010s, fell through for various reasons 5 times and never took place. But what if it all the same took place, I wonder how it would end?

So in the parallel universe, everything worked out, the fighters went into the cage. Commentary by Joe Rogan and Nate Diaz. But there is one problem, your pirate stream stopped showing the picture so you only have their comments to understand what's going on in the fight.
